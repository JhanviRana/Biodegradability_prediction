# Biodegradability_prediction
Predict the biodegradability of different compounds

In this project, we want to predict the biodegradability of different compounds. Supervised Machine Learning (SML) is an important tool that can consider multiple attributes about a compound including its chemical structure and predict its biodegradability in the environment. SML models can help determine which chemicals will be environment friendly helping in making responsible choices during chemical selection for different processes/products.
